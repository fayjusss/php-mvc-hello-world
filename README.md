This a exercise for Mobile Internet Programming course in OAMK. It's a simple hello world web application implemented using MVC architecture in flat PHP. I followed https://r.je/mvc-in-php.html this blog post in order to make it. You can find more details about the functionality, design and how it was coded in the post.

## How to Run This
1. Download the project
2. change directory to the project folder⋅⋅
3. run 'php -S localhost:8000' command (it should start a local server at 8000 port, if you have php installed globally in your machine)⋅⋅
4. visit localhost:8000 from browser
